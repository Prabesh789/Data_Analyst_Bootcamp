-- Common Table Expression (CTE)
/*
A Common Table Expression (CTE) in MySQL is a temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. 
CTEs are defined using the WITH keyword and can be thought of as a more readable and reusable alternative to subqueries.
